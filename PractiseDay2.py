# 1. Ask the user to enter their name and then display their name three times.
#name = input('What is your name? ')

# index = 0
# while index < 3:
#     print(name)
#     index += 1

# 2. Alter program 1 so that it will ask the user to enter their name and a number and then display their name that number of times.
# name_2 = input('What is your name? ')
# number_2 = int(input("Tell me any number"))


# 3. Ask the user to enter their name and display each letter in their name on a separate line.
# name_3 = input('What is your name? ')
# index_3 = 0
# while index_3 < len(name_3):
#     print(name_3[index_3])
#     index_3 += 1
# 4. Change program 3 to also ask for a number. Display their name (one letter at a time on each line) and repeat this for the number of times they entered.
#
# name_4 = input('What is your name? ')
# number_4 = int(input("Tell me any number"))
#
# repeat = 0

# 14. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.
# list_14 = list(range(50))
# result = 0
# for item in list_14:
#     result += item
# print(result)

# 16. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list.

# list_16 = [1, 5, 99, 0, -1, -100]
# #print(max(list_16))
#
# max_value = list_16[0]
# for number in list_16:
#     if max_value < number:
#         max_value = number
# print(max_value)
